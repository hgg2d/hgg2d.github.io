Version 2.0.5
= Features
- Announce codes now have their links properly updated when auto-detected in the
  thread.
- Quicklinks scrolling can now be toggled between instant and smooth scrolling
  It came to my attention that my scrollTo events do not perform well on chrome
  this isn't a problem for Firefox, where I was typically doing testing, so while
  I work on a solution that allows both browsers to work well with smoothscrolling
  I have applied a band-aid fix of instant-scrolling.

Version 2.0.4
= UI Changes
- The preview bar is now sticky to a position within the thread! This will prevent
  users on any common resolution to use the bar without it getting in the way of
  other UI components (tested on 1336x768, 1440x900, 1280x800, 1920x1080, 2560x1440)

Version 2.0.3
= UI Changes
- Changed the location of the quicklinks settings link, it is now located just to the left of the page stats on top of the page
- Now if the Preview Grid setting is disabled, the entire addon disappears, including the grid (hovers still work!)
- Changed the location of the quicklinks bar, it should no longer interfere with native controls

Version 2.0.2
= Features
- Added global enable/disable button

Version 2.0
= Features
- Complete rewrite of the old code
- Previews now have two modes, standard and grid
- - grid layout displays all games with previews in a nice looking grid, enjoy
- Added in custom replacements, these are accessible through the new Settings dialog
- - the custom replacement text matches a regular expression (already calculating
    word boundaries). if you don't know regular expressions, no problem! just put
    your text on the left and don't worry about it.
- Settings have been completely changed
- - Settings dialog is now very clear and reactive to your settings.
